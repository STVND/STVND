# Hi, I’m Steven 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  

I'm new to tech and have had a wonderful time learning programming and find it to be a great exercise in curiosity and self-expression. For now, I'm sharpening my backend skills and occasionally dabbling in digital art (though my stylus is gathering a bit of dust lately).

## 🖥️ About Me

- 💡 Currently loving backend systems moreso than front end systems, but enjoy the challenge of full-stack.
- 🎨 Aspiring graphics programmer | Casual digital artist (when inspiration strikes)
- 🛠️ Top skills:  
  - Go (Golang)
  - Java
  - TypeScript

## 🔥 Favorite Project

[texture-toolkit](https://github.com/STVND/texture-toolkit)  
A project close to my heart as I learn and grow in the world of code and pixels.
